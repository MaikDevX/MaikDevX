# Hi there, I'm Maik! 👋

### 👨‍💻 .NET Developer | C# · .NET 10 · Azure · Blazor | Cloud‑Native Architectures

I'm currently completing my training as an Application Developer (graduating August 2026) and gaining hands‑on project experience at the digital agency **Elements of Arts (EOA)**.  
My focus lies in the Microsoft ecosystem (.NET, C#, Blazor) and in building high‑performance web applications using modern frameworks like Astro.

I bring a structured, analytical and resilient mindset to software engineering — shaped by my years as a professional E‑Sports athlete.

### 🎮 The E‑Sports Connection

Before becoming a developer, I spent several years competing in the **ESL Pro Series**.  
This background shaped how I work today:

- **Strategy:** Thinking in systems and architectures, not just code  
- **Communication:** Clear, precise collaboration in agile teams  
- **Resilience:** Debugging under pressure feels like tournament finals — I stay focused until the issue is solved
