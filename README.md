### 🎮 The E-Sports Connection
During my years as a **Pro-Gamer in the ESL**, I learned that success is the result of deep analysis, millisecond decisions, and extreme team discipline. I bring this "High-Performance Mindset" to every software project:

- **Strategy:** Focusing on system architecture, not just code lines.
- **Communication:** Ensuring clarity and precision in agile sprints.
- **Resilience:** Debugging under time pressure feels like a finals match to me—I don't quit until it's solved.
